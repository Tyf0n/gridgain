## .NET Client

.NET Client is a lightweight gateway to GridGain nodes. Client communicates with grid
nodes via REST interface and provides reduced but powerful subset of GridGain API.
.NET Client allows to use GridGain features from devices and environments where fully-
functional GridGain node could not (or should not) be started.
