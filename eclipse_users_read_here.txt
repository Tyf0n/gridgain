GridGain is shipped with pre-configured .project and .classpath files for Eclipse.

To create GridGain project in Eclipse do the following:

1. If you want to run Scala examples, install the latest version of Scala IDE for Eclipse. See instructions
   here: http://scala-ide.org/docs/user/gettingstarted.html (note that only Eclipse 3.6.2 is fully supported).
   If you are going to use only Java, skip this step.
2. Go to File -> New -> Project... and choose General Project wizard.
3. Give your project a name (e.g., GridGain) and point it to the folder where you unzipped your GridGain
   distribution.
4. If you installed Scala IDE (step 1), go to Project -> Properties -> Builders and disable Java builder
   (leave only Scala builder enabled).
