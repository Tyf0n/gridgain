GridGain is Java based open source middleware for real time big data processing and 
analytics that scales up from one server to thousands of machines. 

GridGain - Community Edition
----------------------------
GridGain allows anyone easily develop, scale and manage compute and data intensive 
JVM based applications using Java, Scala or Groovy++. GridGain provides two major
areas of functionality:

- *Compute Grids*
- *In-Memory Data Grids*

On top of that it provides the multitude of surrounding technologies many of 
which are frequently used by our clients on their own. 

With GridGain your applications can:

- Work in a zero-deployment mode.
- Scale up or down based on demand.
- Cache distributed data in data grid.
- Co-locate data and computations.
- Run sql queries against cached data.
- Store and query JSON objects.
- Speed up task using MapReduce processing.
- Use distributed thread pools.
- Distribute the workload on the grid.
- Use distributed queues and atomics. 
- Effectively exchange messages.
- Auto-discover all grid resources.
- Execute closures on the grid.
- Grid-enable java and scala code.
- ... and much more

GridGain - Enterprise Edition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GridGain Enterprise Edition distribution can be downloaded directly from 
http://www.gridgain.com/downloads.html[] Enterprise Edition comes with additional features
as well as monitoring and management tools. Enterprise Edition is fully backward

Examples
--------
The best way to get started with GridGain is to look through examples. You can find all 
examples under +examples+ folder right at where you installed GridGain. This folder 
contains examples for Java, Scala and some for Groovy. 

You can simply run these examples from your favorite IDE or just command line. All 
examples have documentation on what they do and some basic configuration tips, if any needed.

We suggest to start with HelloWorld examples located at 
+examples/java/org/gridgain/examples/helloworld+ folder. Getting started is easier with 
documentation on our http://bit.ly/bywKFk[Wiki]

API Documentation
------------------
We spend significant amount of time on writing and maintaining Javadoc and Scaladoc for our 
product. All documentation is shipped with it and you can find it under +javadoc+, +groovydoc+,
and +scaladoc+ sub-folder respectively.

You can also find latest released Javadoc online: http://www.gridgain.com/javadoc40C/index.html

Scripts
-------
All scripts that you need to use on a regular basis can be found at +bin+ 
sub-folder. To start a grid node with default configuration simply run +bin/ggstart.sh+ or 
+bin\ggstart.bat+ script - *and you are in the grid!*
