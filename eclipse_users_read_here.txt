GridGain is shipped with pre-configured .project and .classpath files for Eclipse.

To create GridGain project in Eclipse do the following:

1. If you want to run Scala examples, install the latest version of Scala IDE for Eclipse. See instructions
   here: http://scala-ide.org/docs/user/gettingstarted.html (note that only Eclipse 3.6.2 is fully supported).
   If you are going to use only Java, skip this step.
2. Go to 'File' -> 'Import...' and choose 'Existing Projects into Workspace' import source. Click Next.
3. In 'Select root directory' input field enter the path where you unzipped your GridGain distribution (or use
   'Browse...' button). Click Finish.
